							<h1>What we believe in</h1>

							<h3>I collected the tiktoks you sent me to post here.</h3>
							<p>"We're a team. We will balance each other out. Minor setbacks? we'll make a better comeback. Bad day? I'll promise you a better night. We'll keep each other motivated and at the top. Always... as long as you appreciate me and stay consistent. You never need to doubt my loyalty because our love is everything and bigger than anything. You got me and I've got you."</p>
							<p>"Whatever happens with this beautiful story of you and me, I hope you know there wasn't one day that I didn't choose you. There was never one minute when you were a second choice or a second place. Never! I will love you until the end of time, in this life, the next life, any life. I will love you with every last drop of my heart. It's you. It has always been you. And one day, it will be you and me together, and happily ever after."</p>
							<p>"No. I'm not gonna lose feelings for you, they grow more and more every day and no, I'm not gonna leave you cuz my mind is already made up, my future is waiting on you and only you."</p>
							<p>"I will always be on your side. Supporting and loving you through whatever happens. I care about you more than anything. I promise you that as long as I am here, you never will have to go through anything alone again."</p>
							<p>"I choose you yesterday. I choose you today. I will choose you tomorrow. I will always choose you. I'm in love with you. You're my one in a lifetime. You're my puzzle piece. You're my best friend. You're the love of my life. You're my forever and ever. We are imperfect humans, yet perfect for each other. We are a team."</p>
							<p>"I only want you. I'm dating to marry, not to date for 2 or 3 years and break up, that's why I'm willing to fight for our relationship. You are crazy if you think I'm leaving after I saw your insecurities, your Flaws, I saw a side of you no one has before. I would never change anything about you. Your problems are my problems. Your happiness is a priority to me. I wanna know your struggles so I can help you."</p>
